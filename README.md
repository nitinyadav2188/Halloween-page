## 🧙‍♀️ Journey  

Building this project felt like mixing a digital potion of **CSS gradients**, **keyframes**, and **emojis**.  

Here’s what I learned and enjoyed along the way:  

- 💨 **Layered Animations:** Creating a fog effect using multiple transparent SVG layers drifting at different speeds made the atmosphere more realistic.  
- 💡 **Pure CSS Glow:** Using `text-shadow` and gradient tricks gave the Halloween lights that eerie orange-red glow.  
- 💥 **Event-Driven Fun:** The explosion effect that reveals the monster was made using simple JS class toggles, `@keyframes`, and a sprinkle of timing with `setTimeout()`.  
- 🧩 **No Framework Needed:** I realized how much can be achieved with clean HTML and CSS alone — perfect for small creative challenges like this.  
- 🕷️ **Attention to Detail:** The random spider drop script was my favorite part — it adds subtle, ongoing movement that keeps the scene “alive.”  

I also experimented with **CSS filters** like `drop-shadow` and `backdrop-filter: blur()` to give it a more polished, cinematic effect.
